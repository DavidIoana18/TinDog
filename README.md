# TinDog

	Hi!üê∂
	
	I present to you the TinDog website that details the application with the same name that can be downloaded for both apple and android users. The site is created to be accessed on a laptop, tablet and phone. 
	I used Bootstrap which is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages.
  You can access the site here https://davidioana18.github.io/TinDog/
